                        Email is widely used by all the professionals because it is secure and easy to use and this
                        project is nothing but an Email with some extra features. This email operates through voice
                        as well as user can also type manually .It is a <i>User-interactive email sender </i>like other
                        voice assistance devices . Through voice user can interact because it thoroughly describes all
                        details which user had filled by just saying <i>“Read”</i> , by
                        just saying <i>“Cancel”</i> this project automatic gets
                        stop and also gets close , by just clicking on <i>Listen
                            Button </i>user can ask anything whatever user wants , may be his/her details and some
                        predefined questions which I have defined in the
                        project and it will keep asking , so to stop this just say <i>“Break”</i> means user wants to
                        break
                        the process and by just saying <i>"Send”</i> email gets send to
                        destination addresses .<i>User can send messages to more than one address.</i> This Voice
                        controllable
                        email sender supports many formats (pdf, .csv , .jpg, .png , .txt .mp4 , mp3 etc).

                        Portfolio is the best way for students to explain his/her education, skills and abilities,
                        working experience and achievements and it also shows that a student knows how to implement the
                        technologies in the real world and I have also completed this <i>Portfolio</i> which shows my
                        skills
                        ,achievements ,education etc and it is <i>fully responsive</i> means it works properly in pc’s
                        and also in mobiles.
                        I am still working in this project for making it more interactive and responsive.
