                Hii , &#128516 I am a very <i>Cheerful boy</i> and used to smile .I always try to make myself happy and never let
                myself down but When I was kid , I
                never paid attention towards my studies because I had my own dreams and works and I
                was very enthusiastic to fulfill them . I always tried to learn new things but I didn't know how to
                acquire new skills and how to fulfill them. I tried my hardest but things were getting worse and worse
                and I was always thinking how the computer works , who made this , what is an app ,what is a website and
                many more questions .for finding the answers of these questions , I started attending my computer labs
                but again I didn't know how to open and operate a computer and due to my shy nature I was unable to
                explore myself .</p>

                <p>But <b> Time changes everything </b>, during school time that was my first time when I had led a team as a
                <i>Leader</i> and after that I realised that I can explore myself , from that point my life took a new turn and
                with the span of time I explored myself and also I learned a lot of new things in this journey and
                started to do what I loved most with full enthusiasm and still I try my best to learn new things as much
                as possible . I always do things or work in my own fashion with innovations.</p>

            <p>For finding the answers of my all questions I decided to do Btech (Computer science branch )from Lovely
                professional University and I am very happy that I am exploring myself more and also continuously learning
                 new skills.Now I am well aware of the strategy of how to learn new things and also I got all
                the answers to my questions .</p>
